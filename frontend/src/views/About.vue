      <p>NOURRI is an organisation of love and warmth. Grocery stores throw out up to 50% of their produce while its still edible! NOURRI is an idea that allows food banks and food-providing services to retrieve the food items that they wish to have from the leftover foods of the grocery stores.  We allow food banks and food-providing services to know what grocery stores are throwing out and to select exactly which food items and what quantity that they wish to retrieve.   </p>
